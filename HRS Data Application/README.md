# Datapooling_HRS_Only
 Response to reviewer's comments asking for an applied example. 

You can find the main sources of data used in the code here:
HRS Rand longitudinal data 2020 (https://hrsdata.isr.umich.edu/data-products/rand-hrs-longitudinal-file-2020)
HRS 2020 tracker data (https://hrsdata.isr.umich.edu/data-products/cross-wave-tracker-file)
HRS Biomarkers 06 (accessible via email request with HRS account; https://hrsdata.isr.umich.edu/data-products/2006-biomarker-data)
HRS Biomarkers 08 (accessible via email request with HRS account; https://hrsdata.isr.umich.edu/data-products/2008-biomarker-data)
 
Memory composite scores (Wu et al. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22992720/) were not used in analyses but were used in the construction of the full longitudinal dataset. Programmers can either remove code for integration of this data into creation of the dataset or reach out to Peter Buto for data/code access for creation of memory composite scores (Peter.Buto@ucsf.edu)
