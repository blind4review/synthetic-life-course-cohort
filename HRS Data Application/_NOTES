We start with a cohort that has at least one visit in young and one visit in old
This cohort is where we can derive the "truth"
(can't use participants who weren't present in the `old` subset as we don't know their outcome)

We then divide and mask the cohort. 

We can't carry anything from BEFORE the mediator measurement. 
*split the cohort BEFORE carrying forward any observations*

We can carry forward observations in the younger cohort up to 2006, but we shouldn't use them in the matching process. We will limit matching variables to those values from 2006. 

Probably can't carry forward observations in the older cohort

Check in with Scott on how to code health conditions/alcohol_ever as are based on past observations. 
Do we need to re-code SMOKE_EVER such that it truely is smoke ever? (seems to be coded as I would). 
Could get the last observation per participant and cesnor forward. 

Trimming the carry forward in the younger cohort causes some observations to be dropped. (extreme values observed in weight, height, BMI)

Check in with Scott and Maria about Matching_Var weights.

Per Maria, it's fine to use any outcome wave so long as it can approximate the original dataset. 

Currently, if there are missing values for any of the distance variables, the final distance will be treated as missing. If we were to code the missing values as zero, that would artificially shrink the score making the match seem better than it really is. if we were to assign some score, how would we do it?

In the OLD data-set, we actually only have 8342 participants that have at least one wave of data. This is the maximum amount of true matches we should have. 

Maybe go back upstream and limit those in the older cohort to only those who were present in 2006?


============

when we run the model on the truth, limit to those present in the older cohort to make it more comparable. 

Before matching, we can limit to complete cases. 

given concerns using the future to fill in the past, it may make more sense to use 2008 as the matching wave (where HRS would have in theory had BP measures on the entire cohort (both halfs))

============

Consider selecting one of the exercise variables.
Combine Current and Ever into a categorical: Current, ever, never.
Could pull in the outcome year to get a bigger sample size: check for n in these cases. 2014 vs 2016 vs 2018 

=============
11/14/2023

Get rid of most exact variables. 
Distance Variables: HEIGHT & WEIGHT, DIASTOLIC, PULSE

We can put in the exact-matching variables in 03_CalculateWeights as factor variables to yield R2 values.

Got a list of R2 for potential variables to cut-off. Included as instructions_01
(instructions_00a might make more sense)

============
11/15/2023
Re-consider threshold cut-offs? from 0.25 SD to 1.5 SD? Something in between?

Per Maria, get the characteristics of participants who were NOT matched and compare them to those that were matched. 
  After BL matching, is any one left out? how do they differ from those who were matched?
  Repeat after TV matching. 
  How would this look for distance matching? 
============
11/16/2023
In the matching script, save out a non-absolute value of the distance match so that when we are looking at the summary descriptives of the matches in 06_OutputTables, weget a better idea of the difference between the cohorts

Get a list of IDs for those who were matched and those who weren't in the older sample. Make a Table 1 for those that were matched/not-matched. 

Make a list where each key is a TV variable with the values being the possible values. Loop over and run a unique

============

When thinking about diabetes as the outcome, consider:
  Restrict to people w/o diabetes in 2008
  Match on HbA1c
Alternatively for binary outcomes, can consider current depression?

============
11/30/2023

Join in BMI_HRS_2 to the table1_univariate comparing matched and unmatched participants. 

============
12/06/2023

Go on with different outcomes. Use older analyses to see what covariates we could possibly use to improve the matching. 

============
12/19/2023

Check in with Scott and Maria as to whether missing values are okay to use across permutations. 

============
01/04/2024

in script 06, sd overwrites mean for distances (line 154) - fixed. 
Would be better to take the absolute difference rather than a direct subtraction. 


===========
01/25/2024
Rather than univariate cutoffs/thresholds, consider a combined cutoff (think euclidean distance of matched pairs)

Or make the cutoff differ by diabetes/non-diabetes group such that the threshold value is calculated within each group. 
What to do with multiple continuous variables? 

Match on residuals?
